That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .   You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?

You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did . Admit it .   I worked hard too . But she always gives me a lower grade .   If you think that she is not fair with your work then you should talk to her in person instead of stewing over it .

970,What a lovely day . The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan .   Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin .   Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries .   While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries .   That is a really interesting fact .   I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach .   Just do whatever you feel like doing .   ( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy . Let's put the stuff under the tree .   Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade .   I can't wait to play in the water . My feet are burning when I stand on the sand .

4392, then it wouldn ’ t have happened .   He did . It was one of the best ones available . But that didn ’ t stop them from disabling it . And on a crowded street too .   Didn ’ t anyone stop them ?   You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away .   Wow , they were good . I guess criminals aren ’ t that dumb after all .   That ’ s not the end . They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck .

848, for example .   I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes .   The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . It well be unpopular .   That ’ s a good point . Car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it .
