5976,"And how would you describe yourself , Miss Tao ? What kind of person are you ?   Well , as I mentioned before , I think I am easy-going . I enjoy working and talking with people and I'm a responsible person .   Did you have any difficulty getting along with fellow students or teachers ?   No . Not at all . I'm quite easy-going .   What's your strong points ?   Oh , I'm very responsible , I can make fast decisions , and I do not need much supervision . I enjoy completing challenging tasks .   What do you dislike most about your job ?   Probably routine , dull work . Oh , I am much more enthusiastic if I'm given a challenge and responsibility .   What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee ?   A friendly one . I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question .   Sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful . Foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily , and they show it . Are you sure you can handle this stress ? How do you deal with conflict in your present job ?   Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under . It's kind of like being in a family . Often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . A company is like a family , it has good times and bad times .   How do you feel about overtime work ?   That's no problem . I know that every company has busy periods . When this happens , I'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done .   What is most important to you in a job ?   I want to feel that I am making a real contribution to the company , so I would like my boss to trust me with important work .   Do you think that you are introverted or extroverted ?   I'm quite outspoken . I enjoy calling a spade a spade and hate talking in a roundabout way . So I'd call myself outgoing .   Under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper ?   Seldom . But I hate someone's frequently being late or lazy .   OK . What are your strong points ?   Hmm . as I mentioned , I can work well under pressure and I enjoy work that challenges me . I think that my English ability is also a strong point .   And your weaknesses ?   I think I sometimes try to be over-organized . So I am learning how to let some things go and concentrate on the most important part of my job .
